# Tornado Portal - B2B SaaS Partner Portal Development Plan

## Project Overview
Building "Tornado Portal" - a comprehensive B2B SaaS partner portal with role-based access control (RBAC) for managing the entire quote-to-delivery lifecycle using modern SaaS development practices.

**Status**: Development Phase  
**Last Updated**: January 8, 2025  
**Current Phase**: Phase 2 - Core Business Logic (Partner Management & Security COMPLETED) → Quote-to-Order Flow (NEXT)

---

## MVP Strategy (Practical Approach)

### Core Principle
Start with the simplest possible version that demonstrates partner self-service capabilities, then iterate based on user feedback.

### MVP Scope (Phase 1 & 2)
**Goal**: Basic partner portal with simple quote generation and order tracking

**Include**:
- Simple web dashboard (Next.js 14)
- Basic authentication (GitHub OAuth only initially)
- Simple partner management (single partner for testing)
- Basic product catalog (hardcoded initially)
- Simple quote builder
- Order status simulation

**Exclude for MVP**:
- Multiple OAuth providers
- Complex multi-tenancy
- Advanced RBAC (start with 2-3 basic roles)
- Approval workflows
- Real provisioning integration
- Complex reporting

---

## Recommended Tech Stack (Simplified for MVP)

### Frontend & Backend
- **Framework**: Next.js 14 (App Router) - Stable version
- **Language**: TypeScript with Hungarian notation
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui
- **Database**: Turso (SQLite, your existing account)
- **ORM**: Drizzle ORM (type-safe, simple migrations)
- **Authentication**: NextAuth.js v5 (GitHub only initially)
- **State Management**: Zustand + TanStack Query
- **Hosting**: Vercel (free tier)
- **Cache**: Upstash Redis (free tier)

### Development Tools
- **Version Control**: GitHub
- **Testing**: Vitest (unit) + Playwright (E2E) - add in Phase 2
- **Code Quality**: ESLint + Prettier + TypeScript strict mode

## Hungarian Notation Standards

### Naming Conventions (Strictly Follow):
```typescript
// Variables
const strUserId: string = "user_123";
const intQuantity: number = 5;
const bIsActive: boolean = true;
const arrProducts: Product[] = [];
const objQuote: Quote = {};
const decPrice: number = 99.99; // decimal/money
const dtCreated: Date = new Date();

// Functions
function fnCreateQuote(objParams: QuoteParams): Promise<Quote>
function fnCalculateTotal(arrItems: QuoteItem[]): number
function fnValidatePermissions(strUserId: string): boolean

// Components
const CmpProductList = () => {}
const CmpQuoteBuilder = () => {}
const CmpOrderTracker = () => {}

// Types/Interfaces
interface IUser { ... }
interface IQuote { ... }
type TQuoteStatus = 'draft' | 'sent' | 'approved';
enum EUserRole { ... }
```
