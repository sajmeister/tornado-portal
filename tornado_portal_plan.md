# Tornado Portal - B2B SaaS Partner Portal Development Plan

## Project Overview
Building "Tornado Portal" - a comprehensive B2B SaaS partner portal with role-based access control (RBAC) for managing the entire quote-to-delivery lifecycle using modern SaaS development practices.

**Status**: Development Phase  
**Last Updated**: January 8, 2025  
**Current Phase**: Phase 2 - Core Business Logic (Partner Management & Security COMPLETED) → Quote-to-Order Flow (COMPLETED) → Order Processing Simulation (COMPLETED) → Quote Workflow Refinement (COMPLETED) → Polish & Testing (NEXT)

---

## MVP Strategy (Practical Approach)

### Core Principle
Start with the simplest possible version that demonstrates partner self-service capabilities, then iterate based on user feedback.

### MVP Scope (Phase 1 & 2)
**Goal**: Basic partner portal with simple quote generation and order tracking

**Include**:
- Simple web dashboard (Next.js 14)
- Basic authentication (GitHub OAuth only initially)
- Simple partner management (single partner for testing)
- Basic product catalog (hardcoded initially)
- Simple quote builder
- Order status simulation

**Exclude for MVP**:
- Multiple OAuth providers
- Complex multi-tenancy
- Advanced RBAC (start with 2-3 basic roles)
- Approval workflows
- Real provisioning integration
- Complex reporting

---

## Recommended Tech Stack (Simplified for MVP)

## Hungarian Notation Standards

### Naming Conventions (Strictly Follow):
```typescript
// Variables
const strUserId: string = "user_123";
const intQuantity: number = 5;
const bIsActive: boolean = true;
const arrProducts: Product[] = [];
const objQuote: Quote = {};
const decPrice: number = 99.99; // decimal/money
const dtCreated: Date = new Date();

// Functions
function fnCreateQuote(objParams: QuoteParams): Promise<Quote>
function fnCalculateTotal(arrItems: QuoteItem[]): number
function fnValidatePermissions(strUserId: string): boolean

// Components
const CmpProductList = () => {}
const CmpQuoteBuilder = () => {}
const CmpOrderTracker = () => {}

// Types/Interfaces
interface IUser { ... }
interface IQuote { ... }
type TQuoteStatus = 'draft' | 'sent' | 'approved';
enum EUserRole { ... }
```

## Step-by-Step Setup Guide

### Initial Setup Steps:
1. **Create GitHub Repository** ✅
   - Create new repo: `tornado-portal`
   - Clone locally
   - Add this file as `README.md`

2. **Create Next.js Project** ✅
   ```bash
   npx create-next-app@14 . --typescript --tailwind --eslint --app
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies** ✅
   ```bash
   npm install next-auth@beta drizzle-orm @libsql/client
   npm install @radix-ui/react-slot class-variance-authority clsx lucide-react tailwind-merge
   npm install -D drizzle-kit @types/node
   ```

4. **Set up GitHub OAuth** ✅
   - Go to GitHub.com > Settings > Developer settings > OAuth Apps
   - Create new OAuth App
   - Homepage URL: `http://localhost:3000`
   - Callback URL: `http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/github`
   - Note Client ID and Client Secret

5. **Environment Variables** ✅
   - Copy `.env.local.example` to `.env.local`
   - Fill in GitHub OAuth credentials
   - Add NextAuth secret: `openssl rand -base64 32`

6. **Deploy to Vercel** ✅
